/**
 * Compute CRC32 lookup tables as described at:
 * https://github.com/komrad36/CRC#option-6-1-byte-tabular
 *
 * An iteration of CRC computation can be performed on 8 bits of input at once. By pre-computing a
 * table of the values of CRC(?) for all 2^8 = 256 possible byte values, during the final
 * computation we can replace a loop over 8 bits with a single lookup in the table.
 *
 * For further speedup, we can also pre-compute the values of CRC(?0) for all possible bytes when a
 * zero byte is appended. Then we can process two bytes of input at once by computing CRC(AB) =
 * CRC(A0) ^ CRC(B), using one lookup in the CRC(?0) table and one lookup in the CRC(?) table.
 *
 * The same technique applies for any number of bytes to be processed at once, although the speed
 * improvements diminish.
 *
 * @param polynomial The binary representation of the polynomial to use (reversed, i.e. most
 * significant bit represents x^0).
 * @param numTables The number of bytes of input that will be processed at once.
